Data Cleaner - Designated Taxa Module
-------------------------------------

This module enables a verification notification for any taxa that have designations. It is
therefore depends on :doc:`taxon-designations`. Unlike most other Data Cleaner modules, 
this module does not require a rule to be created in the Warehouse's **Admin > 
Verification Rules** screen as there are no configuration options.
