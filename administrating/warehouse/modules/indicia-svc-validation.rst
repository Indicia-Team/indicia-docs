Indicia Validation Services Module
----------------------------------

This is an optional module which enable web services to check a proposed record's
validity. It is not used by the standard Indicia forms which rely on client side
JavaScript to perform validation functions instead as this is more efficient, so can
normally be safely disabled. For more details of these web services please refer to the
:doc:`developer documentation <../../../developing/web-services/validation-services>`.
