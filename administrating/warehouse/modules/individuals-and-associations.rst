Individuals and Associations Module
-----------------------------------

This advanced module extends the Indicia module to support the recording and reporting of:

* Individuals and family groups of organisms
* Associations between individuals and organisms, e.g. parent-child relationships
* Identification marks such as colour patterns or rings

This module was designed in conjunction with the `Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust
<http://wwt.org.uk>`_ to support colour marked observations of geese, swans and other
wildfowl, but it is sufficiently generic to support other taxon groups.
