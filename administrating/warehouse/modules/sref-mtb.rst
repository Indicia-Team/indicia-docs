MTB Spatial References Module
-----------------------------

This module is one of a suite of modules which provide handling of different spatial
reference notation systems, in this case the German Me√ütischblatt system. It is only
required on warehouses which support German MTB Grid references for data entry or
reporting.

It performs the following tasks:

* Declares the underlying projection's `SRID <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRID>`_ to be 
  `4745 <http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4745/>`_, which is the numeric code given to
  the RD/83 projection.
* Provides a method for checking the format of a provided spatial reference.
* Provides conversions for MTB Grid references to and from a polygon in the underlying 
  projection.
