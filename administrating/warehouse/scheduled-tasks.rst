Scheduled Tasks
===============

Because an Indicia server can support a large number of client websites, each of which
submits data and runs sometimes complex queries for reporting and mapping, it is
imperative that we consider performance at every step. One of the ways we can improve
performance is to move certain tasks offline, which is appropriate if the task does not
need to be run at the exact moment a record is submitted, or if we can pre-empt complex
report joins that are going to run repeatedly. Examples include running automated
verification checks against incoming records, indexing them against complex site
boundaries and triggers against incoming data generating notifications.

Instead of running these processes each time data is added, a task is scheduled to run
on a periodic basis (e.g. once per hour) which sweeps up all the records since the last
time it was ran. This is done by setting up an operating system task on the server which
simply accesses the URL ``/index.php/scheduled_task`` on your warehouse server. On a
Linux Apache server, the best way to do this is using `Cron
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_ whereas on Windows you may like to consider using
the `Task Scheduler <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Scheduler>`_. You can also use
your web browser to access this url if required, though this is only really appropriate
for development and testing purposes as you would need to do this regularly throughout
the day.

When using a scheduler on the server itself you do not need to launch and kill a browser
process as php/kohana can be run from the command line. The command to execute will be
in the form:

  php path/to/file/index.php scheduled_tasks

You will need to insert your path to the Kohana index.php file, enclosing it in inverted
commas if it contains spaces. 

.. tip::

  If using the command line then you must ensure that the task is run using the same user
  as the web-server process (e.g. Apache or IIS) so that if the task creates a new log
  file on the warehouse, the file has the correct ownership.

Controlling which task is run
-----------------------------

The scheduled tasks process runs the notifications system plus any modules on the
warehouse that declare they should be scheduled to run. You can control exactly which
modules are run by appending a **tasks** URL parameter containing a comma separated list
of task names. The task names available are:

* **notifications** - fires the triggers and notifications system.
* **all_modules** - fires all the scheduled modules.
* **_module name_** - provide the folder name for a module to fire it specifically.

As an example the following URL triggers just the cache builder and data cleaner module to 
fire::

  http://www.example.com/indicia/index.php/scheduled_tasks?tasks=cache_builder,data_cleaner

Using this approach it is possible to set up several different tasks which are repeated
at different frequencies, e.g. to run the notifications system once an hour, the data
cleaner once a night and the cache_builder every five minutes.

Warehouse functionality dependent on scheduled tasks
----------------------------------------------------

The following functions require the scheduled tasks to be run at least periodically in 
order to work:

* The warehouse :doc:`modules/cache-builder`. This module prepares simplified flat tables 
  of the occurrences, taxa and term parts of the data model to significantly improve
  reporting performance.
* The warehouse :doc:`modules/data-cleaner`. This runs automated verification checks 
  against the incoming records.
* The warehouse :doc:`modules/spatial-index-builder` module. This preempts the need to perform
  spatial joins to build lists of records in complex vice county and other similar 
  boundaries.
* The warehouse :doc:`modules/notify-verifications-and-comments`. This sends notifications of
  automated verifications and record comments back to the original recorder of the record.
* The warehouse :doc:`modules/notify-pending-groups-users`. This sends notifications when
  a user requests membership of a group to the group's administrators.
* The warehouse :doc:`modules/notification-emails`. This module sends notifications as 
  emails or digest emails according to the settings in the `user_email_notification_settings`
  table for each user.
* The warehouse functionality for :doc:`triggers-actions`.
