Welcome to the Indicia Advanced Training course. This course takes you through the steps
required to build a complete working website similar to `iRecord
<http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord>`_ starting with a blank Drupal + Indicia iforms site.
Rather than doing things the easy way, we'll be diving in to as much detail as we can fit
in the day. This way we'll be learning some of the advanced configuration techniques
available in the Indicia ecosystem including templating, notification emails and PHP
coding using the Indicia Client Helpers API. Through the course you will cover:

* The best way to associate users with their records.
* Advanced configuration of data entry forms
* Creating custom attributes from scratch
* Overriding the page stylesheets
* Cloning pages to make similar forms
* Adding a drop down menu system to the site
* Building a library of forms with the facility for recorders to keep a list of preferred
  forms
* Using the new Dynamic Reports page
* Adding a custom home page

.. tip::

  All the course material is available via the new documentation website on
  `Read the Docs <http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org>`_.
