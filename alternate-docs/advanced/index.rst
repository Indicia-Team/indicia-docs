  These tutorials are more advanced than the Introduction to Instant Indicia, so before
  starting it is worth making sure you at least know the basics of Drupal and Instant 
  Indicia. You should have:
  
  * completed the Instant Indicia tutorials, or have a good understanding
    of using the Indicia warehouse and Drupal IForm module.
  * a warehouse which you have registered a website on that you can experiment with.
  * a species list loaded onto the website for you to use, preferably with multiple taxon
    groups.
  * a fresh copy of Instant Indicia, updated with the latest code.

Welcome to the Indicia Advanced Training course. This course takes you through the steps
required to build a complete working website similar to `iRecord
<http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord>`_ starting with a blank Instant Indicia site. In doing so
we'll be learning some of the advanced configuration techniques available in the Indicia
ecosystem including templating, notification emails and PHP coding using the Indicia
Client Helpers API. Through the course you will cover:

* The best way to associate users with their records.
* Advanced configuration of data entry forms

.. tip::

  All the course material is available via the new documentation website on 
  `Read the Docs <http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org>`_.
