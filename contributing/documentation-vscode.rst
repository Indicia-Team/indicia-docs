*****************************************************
Using Visual Studio Code to update the Indicia Manual
*****************************************************

There are many different environments you could set up on your computer 
to edit Restructured Text (RST). The simplest and most effective we have
found is to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and, optionally, an extension 
called 'reStructuredText' that lets you to preview RST in a form closer
to what readers of the Indicia Manual will eventually see.

Since VS Code is a cross-platform tool available for Windows,
MacOS and Linux, we can safely recommend it to most people who
want to contribute jo the Indicia documentation.

You can read about VS Code (which is free to use) and install it 
from the `Visual Studio Code
website <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_. VS Code is a lightweight
code that can be used to produce code in many different languages.
Furthermore a large number of extensions (plugins) are available 
to support language-specific features, including several for RST.

You can experiment yourself with the different RST extensions,
but we have found the 'reStructuredText' extension from LeXtudio to
provide a reasonable fast preview feature.

VS Code also offers integrated source control with through Git. You
can use these integrated GUI features to link with the Indicia GitHub
repositories. If you prefer to use Git from the command line, VS Code
includes integrated terminal windows that are very convenient for this.
