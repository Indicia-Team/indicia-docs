Contributing to the documentation
#################################

This is a placeholder for notes on how to contribute to the Indicia 
documentation.

Register on `github <https://github.com/>`_.

Learn how to edit text using `Restructured Text <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_.

The `git repository is here <https://github.com/johnvanbreda/indicia-docs>`_.
You can use the Edit links within github on each page, or use this URL to 
clone a local copy of the repository with a git client, make edits using 
a text editor then synchronise the changes back. The latter approach is better
when doing more significant updates.

One tool which works as a git Client is the `official github client <http://mac.github.com/>`_.
