website_id,integer,,No,Foreign key to the websites table. Website that the occurrence record is linked to.

training,boolean,false,No,Flag indicating if this record was created for training purposes and is therefore not considered real.
sensitivity_precision,integer,,Yes,"Precision of grid references for public access of records that are sensitive. For example, set to 1000 to limit public access to a 1km grid square. If null then not sensitive."
release_status,character (1),'R'::bpchar,Yes,"Release states of this record. R - released, P - recorder has requested a precheck before release, U - unreleased as part of a project whcih is witholding records until completion."
