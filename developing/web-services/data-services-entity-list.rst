Data Services - list of available entities
==========================================

The following list describes the entities which can be accessed via a call to the data
services, either when :doc:`reading a single record <data-services-read-record>` or a
:doc:`set of records <data-services-read-dataset>`. Apart from for a small number of
special cases, each entity's records are read via a view called list_*, detail_* or gv_*
where * is the entity name and list, detail or gv are provided in the **view** web service
request parameter. Also, most views return a website_id for each record and this is used
to filter the records to those that are available to the calling website. Those which are
not filtered in this way are indicated in the **Website restrictions** column.
