Data Services - reading a dataset
=================================

As well as the :doc:`support for reading individual records from the database
<data-services-read-record>`, the Data Services provide support for querying multiple
records in one request. Reading a set of records from the Data Services follows the
:doc:`general principles for reading data <data-services-reading>`. If your request URL
contains the singular form of the table name, plus authentication tokens and no other 
parameters then you will receive a JSON document containing all the records from that
entity which your website is allowed to see. There are a number of GET or POST parameters
which can filter, format and sort the results as described below.

Filtering
---------

The following options control the records which are returned:

* Provide a URL parameter with the same name as a field in the dataset you are loading
  from set to the value you want to filter to. Use an asterisk as a wildcard in string
  filters or NULL to filter for null values. The fields available in the dataset which 
  you can filter against are those available in the view which you are loading from, 
  for example if you are accessing the sample model with a `view=list` parameter, then
  the fields available will be those in the list_samples view.
* Set a URL parameter called **limit** to a positive whole number in order to limit the
  number of records returned.
* Set a URL parameter called **offset** to a positive whole number in order to skip a
  certain number of records from the beginning of the dataset.
* Set a parameter called **query** to specify an advanced query filter as described below.

Where a simple field filter is not sufficient, you can use the query parameter to build
more advanced queries against the data. This is achieved by passing a JSON object in the
query parameter. The top level of the object is an associative array of the filter type
name, each containing a set of the parameters required for the filter type. So, for a
simple example of a WHERE clause definition, you might pass the following using PHP which
generates the SQL given:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  ...
  'query' => urlencode(json_encode(array('where'=>array('survey_id', 5))))
  ...
  ?>

This generates:

.. code-block:: sql

  WHERE survey_id=5
  
In the case where you need 2 where clauses, you can do

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  ...
  'query' => urlencode(json_encode(array(
    'where'=>array(array('survey_id'=>5, 'entered_sref_system'=>'OSGB'))
  )))
  ...
  ?>
  
This generates:
  
.. code-block:: sql

  WHERE survey_id=5 AND entered_sref_system='OSGB'

The supported filter type names are as follows:

* **where** -	Takes either 2 parameters, the fieldname and the value, or a single string 
  parameter which is the join SQL, or an associative array of fieldnames and values. 
  Multiple conditions are joined using an AND. If you need to support complex where syntax 
  (e.g. wrapping parenthesis around 2 OR'ed statements) then this can be achieved by 
  supplying a single string parameter containing the full SQL required for the WHERE 
  clause.
* **orwhere** - Identical to the where filter type, but conditions are joined using an OR.
* **in** - Takes 2 parameters, a fieldname and an array of values to generate an IN (...) 
  SQL clause.
* **notin**	- Identical to in but generates a NOT IN clause.
* **like** -	Takes 2 parameters, a fieldname and a value to generate a LIKE SQL 
  statement.
* **orlike** - Identical to the like filter type, but conditions are joined using an OR.

More may be added in future.
  
Sorting
-------

The following parameters can be used to control the sort order of the response.

* **orderby** -	Allows the field that the results are to be sorted by to be specified. This 
  can be a comma separated list of field names to sort.
* **sortdir** - Specifies the sort direction. Options are ASC or DESC. This can be a comma 
  separated list of **ASC** or **DESC** entries with the same number of entries as in 
  orderby to define the order of each field. If there are less entries then the sort order 
  for unspecified fields will be ASC.

Examples
--------

The following examples illustrate some Data Services requests that return multiple 
records:

Example 1 - retrieve all taxon groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request uses the limit parameter to restrict the response to the first 4 records.

Request::

  http://localhost/indicia/index.php/services/data/taxon_group
  ?mode=json&nonce=<nonce>&auth_token=<auth_token>&limit=4
  
Example response:

.. code-block:: json
  
  [
    {"id":"1","title":"Butterflies","website_id":null}
    {"id":"2","title":"Bugs","website_id":null}
    {"id":"3","title":"Moths","website_id":null}
    {"id":"4","title":"Beetles","website_id":null}
    etc...
