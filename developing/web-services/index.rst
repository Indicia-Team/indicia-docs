Web Services

Indicia's web services are a key component of the Indicia warehouse, since all
interactions between the client website and the warehouse are via web services. This
approach means there is no practical difference between hosting your client website on 
the same machine as the warehouse or hosting it on the other side of the globe. The web
services are effectively a set of functions that can be called remotely, for example 
functions which return data, allow addition of records to the warehouse, or perform 
utility calculations such as spatial reference transformations where these can't be 
handled on the client.
