Security Services Details
=========================

If you are using the Drupal integration or PHP client helpers API then there is 
no need to learn more about the Security Services than the information already 
covered under :doc:`../authentication-client-helpers`. However if you do need 
details of the services available for authentication then this section provides
all you need. Before reading on you should familiarise yourself with the 
:doc:`../authentication-overview`.
