Validation Services
-------------------

.. note::

  The Validation Services are provided with Indicia warehouses for backward compatibility
  reasons only, since all current and new code uses client-side JavaScript to perform
  validation of forms before submission, since this is more efficient as it does not
  require a call to the server.
