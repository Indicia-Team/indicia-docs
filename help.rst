Getting help
------------

Indicia currently has the following support and help options:

* A forum at http://forums.nbn.org.uk/viewforum.php?id=25
* A live chatroom at http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/indicia

If you would like something more concrete than free community support then there
are a number of developers available who can provide paid for support or compete
website development. The best approach would be to post a message requesting 
assistance on the forum. 

.. note::

  When choosing the technologies used for Indicia, we have consciously elected
  to stick with widely used, free and open source tools. Therefore finding 
  developers with the right skillset (mainly PHP and JavaScript) is relatively
  easy and there are no up-front costs to get set up as a developer. You can 
  :doc:`find out more about the technology <introduction/technology>` or 
  :doc:`dive straight in to the developer documentation <developing/index>`.
