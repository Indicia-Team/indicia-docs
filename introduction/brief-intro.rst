Overview
########

Indicia is the online biological recording toolkit conceived as part of the 
`Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) <http://www.OPALexplorenature.org/>`_ and
managed by the `Centre for Ecology and Hydrology <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/>`_.
Indicia is a free and open source project serving the biological recording 
community within the UK and Europe.

A toolkit that simplifies the construction of websites, Indicia supports 
wildlife observation recording forms that are as simple or advanced as you need,
allowing photo upload, reporting, mapping and verification of the records. By 
providing these facilities via a comprehensive set of highly configurable 
components, Indicia can be used to build diverse and unique recording sites.
Rather than providing a fixed, off the shelf system, Indicia provides a
infrastructure and tools for rapidly developing online recording websites that 
fit your exact needs. 

Because Indicia allows complete flexibility in the data entry forms that can be
created, it is suitable for public participation surveys targeted at school
children right through to long-term monitoring projects performed by 
professional surveyors. 

Some key features of Indicia:

* Build any wildlife recording form to suit your survey's needs
* Photo upload
* Pick grid references from a Google, Bing or any other map layer so say goodbye
  to incorrectly transcribed grid references
* Rapid entry of lists of species at a site
* Tools provided for expert verification of data including integration with the
  `NBN Record Cleaner <http://www.nbn.org.uk/Tools-Resources/Recording-Resources/NBN-Record-Cleaner.aspx>`_
  rules (no need to download data into Record Cleaner) and 
  bulk verification facilities
* Easily download data as spreadsheets or NBN Exchange format
* Access data via spatial web services direct from a GIS application or Google
  Earth.
* Can be integrated into many existing websites or build a complete site using 
  Indicia along with the power of `Drupal <http://drupal.org>`_.
* Support for multi-lingual websites - build forms in any language or even 
  to support multiple languages.
* All this with no software fees
