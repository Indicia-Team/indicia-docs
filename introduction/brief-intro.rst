A brief introduction to the Indicia project
###########################################

Indicia is the online biological recording toolkit conceived as part of the 
`Open Air Laboratories Network (OPAL) <http://www.OPALexplorenature.org/>`_ and
managed by the `Centre for Ecology and Hydrology <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/>`.
Indicia is a free and open source project serving the biological recording 
community within the UK and Europe.

Online biological recording refers to websites that allow users to contribute 
their wildlife sightings, or records, to a database. Rather than providing a
fixed, off the shelf solution, Indicia provides an infrastructure and tools
for rapidly developing online recording websites that fit your exact needs. 
Indicia includes components for developing the data input forms as well as 
reports, mapping and data management facilities required to support the data
entry systems. 

Because Indicia allows complete flexibility in the data entry forms that can be
created, it is suitable for public participation surveys targeted at school
children right through to long-term monitoring projects performed by 
professional surveyors. 

Some key features of Indicia:

* No software fees
* Build any wildlife recording form to suit your survey's needs
* Photo upload
* Pick grid references from a map so no chance of mistakes
* Rapid entry of lists of species at a site
* Tools provided for expert verification of data including integration with the
  NBN Record Cleaner rules (no need to download data into Record Cleaner) and bulk
  verification facilities
* Easily download data as spreadsheets or NBN Exchange format
* Access data via spatial web services direct from a GIS application or Google
  Earth.
