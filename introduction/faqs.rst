How much does Indicia cost?
---------------------------

Indicia is free and open source software and there are no costs for the software
itself or any of the software it is dependent on. However, before implementing a
project using Indicia please take into account the cost of web-hosting and 
developing your Indicia powered site, although the latter should be considerably
cheaper using Indicia than if starting from scratch.

What is Instant Indicia?
------------------------

Instant Indicia is a new product and is the quickest way to build websites using
Indicia. Instant Indicia is based on the Drupal Content Management System, a 
popular and widely supported solution for building websites that allow you to 
add content without writing code. Online recording functionality is integrated 
right into the Drupal platform so you can simply select from the list of 
"features" you want to enable on your website – input forms, reports, maps, 
verification etc – and Instant Indicia does the rest. :doc:`Find out more about

Does Indicia allow photos to be uploaded with records?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Indicia supports photo upload for records as well as for site data. The 
uploader also supports resizing the image within the browser making uploads 
much faster as well as showing a progress bar during the upload.

Does Indicia support expert verification of the records?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Indicia can be used to build sites that support expert verification of 
incoming records and includes ready made verification pages that can be 
added to any Indicia site. Full details of records are available including 
photos, maps with overlay of existing distributions of the species for 
comparison and phenology charts built using existing records. The verification 
facilities support bulk verification of records, e.g. verify all records of a 
common and easy to identify species, or all records by a trusted recorder. Email
communication facilities and integration with NBN Record Cleaner rules combine 
to make verification both simple and fast.


Is Indicia supported?
---------------------

Is there a mobile interface for Indicia?
----------------------------------------

There isn't a generic approach to building mobile applications in Indicia at the
present time, however Indicia provides an excellent platform for building mobile
applications against since it provides the services required to store records, 
lookup species names and report on the data that a mobile application requires.
`PlantTracker <http://planttracker.naturelocator.org>`_ is a good example of a 
mobile application written using Indicia as the platform for storing the 
records, thereby benefitting from the reporting, verification and other data 
management tools.

What do I need to do to setup my own online recording site?

  php etc

How do I access the data held in Indicia?
-----------------------------------------

Because Indicia is a web application as opposed to a desktop application, the 
way you access the data is different. There are many options available but 
typically you will use one of the following:

* Download the data in spreadsheet format
* Download the data in NBN Exchange format
* Directly access the data from a GIS or other mapping program such as Google 
  Earth using web services.

.. note::

  It is possible to run powerful queries on the web-server itself so 
  you don't even need to download the data to perform many basic analysis 
  operations. 

Can Indicia use a MySQL database?
---------------------------------
