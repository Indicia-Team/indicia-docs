What is Instant Indicia?
------------------------

Instant Indicia is a new product and is the quickest way to build websites using
Indicia. Instant Indicia is based on the Drupal Content Management System, a 
popular and widely supported solution for building websites that allow you to 
add content without writing code. Online recording functionality is integrated 
right into the Drupal platform so you can simply select from the list of 
"features" you want to enable on your website – input forms, reports, maps, 
verification etc – and Instant Indicia does the rest. :doc:`Find out more about
