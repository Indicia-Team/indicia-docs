This section of the documentation is a great place to start for an overview and 
general introduction to the Indicia online recording toolkit project.

Indicia provides the pieces you need to build online biological recording 
websites. A toolkit that simplifies the construction of websites, Indicia 
supports wildlife observation recording forms that are as simple or advanced as 
you need and also allows photo upload, reporting, mapping and verification of 
the records.
