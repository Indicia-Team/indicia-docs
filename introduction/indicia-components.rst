Indicia Components
##################

In order to understand how to setup your own online recording using Indicia you 
first need to understand the key components that go together to build the 
system.

The main “guts” of Indicia are provided in the warehouse component. The 
warehouse’s primary purpose is to store the records, including observations, 
species data, sites, people and lists of terms used in the data. When a recorder
uses the online recording facilities on an Indicia site, they do not need to be
aware of the warehouse as the web interface they use is kept completely 
separate. However, the warehouse does have its own administration interface 
which we will look at later, designed for use by people whose role it is to set
up and configure the surveys that are being conducted.

Because the database used by Indicia is fully able to handle geographic objects
such as site boundaries, known as being spatially enabled, you can link the data
in a warehouse easily to a GIS (Geographical Information System) application, 
Google Earth or online map. However this does mean that the technology used on
the warehouse may not run on a typical low-cost hosted website account. Don’t
worry though as Indicia was designed with this in mind. The warehouse can run
on a different web server to your recording website so it can be hosted 
completely separately to your online recording website. A single warehouse 
installation can support multiple online recording websites making it possible
for organisations that do have the capacity to host a warehouse to share this
resource with other organisations which don’t. For example in the following
diagram the warehouse supports 3 online recording websites for various schemes 
and societies (it could be many more).

The second component required of course is the online recording website itself.
This is the part you will definitely need to build but Indicia is designed to 
make this as simple as possible. It is also designed to run on the vast majority
of web servers including very cheap hosted accounts on shared servers. Because 
most of the hard work is done by the warehouse, Indicia does not place a huge 
burden on the server hosting the online recording website and only uses 
technologies that are more or less standard these days on nearly all web 
servers.

There are several possible approaches to building your website using 
Indicia, these include:

* Instant Indicia - the fastest and simplest way to get started
* The Drupal IForm module
* Using the Indicia programmers interface from your own PHP code
