Instant Indicia
###############

Instant Indicia is specifically an extension of the Drupal CMS that includes the
following:

* Out of the box integration with Indicia.
* A number of additional modules useful for building biodiversity recording 
  sites.
* A number of ready-made building blocks (called features) that you can enable 
  in order to build the fundamental components of your site in minutes. These 
  include features such as recording forms and reports as well as home pages, 
  forums and other functionality.

Imagine a system which is provided as a number of ready-made pieces, where you 
can just tick off the ones you want and they will be added to your website more 
or less instantly. Whether it is an online recording form, a distribution map, 
or a discussion forum for getting help with identifications, you just need to 
tick a box to turn it on. Thatâ€™s what Instant Indicia is all about and that is 
what we are going to do in this course.
