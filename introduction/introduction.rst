Indicia provides the pieces you need to build online biological recording 
websites. A toolkit that simplifies the construction of websites, Indicia 
supports wildlife observation recording forms that are as simple or advanced as 
you need, also allowing photo upload, reporting, mapping and verification of the
records. By providing these facilities via a comprehensive set of highly 
configurable components, Indicia can be used to build diverse and unique 
recording sites. Indicia is not a fixed, off the shelf system, instead it 
provides a infrastructure and tools for rapidly developing online recording 
websites that fit your exact needs.

Because Indicia allows complete flexibility in the data entry forms that can be
created, it is suitable for anything from public participation surveys targeted
at school children right through to structured long-term monitoring projects 
performed by professional surveyors. 

Conceived as part of the 
`Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) <http://www.OPALexplorenature.org/>`_ and
managed by the `Centre for Ecology and Hydrology <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/>`_, 
Indicia is free and open source software serving the biological recording 
community within the UK and Europe.
