What exactly is Indicia?
------------------------

A toolkit that simplifies the construction of websites, Indicia supports 
wildlife observation recording forms that are as simple or advanced as you need,
also allowing photo upload, reporting, mapping and verification of the records. 
By providing these facilities via a comprehensive set of highly configurable 
components, Indicia can be used to build diverse and unique recording sites.
Indicai is not a fixed, off the shelf system, instead it provides a
infrastructure and tools for rapidly developing online recording websites that 
fit your exact needs.

Because Indicia allows complete flexibility in the data entry forms that can be
created, it is suitable for public participation surveys targeted at school
children right through to long-term monitoring projects performed by 
professional surveyors. 

Conceived as part of the 
`Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) <http://www.OPALexplorenature.org/>`_ and
managed by the `Centre for Ecology and Hydrology <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/>`_, 
Indicia is free and open source software serving the biological recording 
community within the UK and Europe.
