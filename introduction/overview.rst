What exactly is Indicia?
========================

.. sidebar:: Highlights
  
    * An online recording system for wildlife records
    * Flexible and cost effective
    * Easy and rapid data entry
    * Fully customisable
    * An open source, community owned project

Put simply, Indicia's aim is to reduce the cost of and increase the quality of
websites developed for biological recording. 

It achieves this by providing a comprehensive set of highly 
configurable components, so Indicia can be used to build diverse and unique 
recording sites. Indicia is not a fixed, off the shelf system, instead it 
provides an infrastructure and tools for rapidly developing online recording 
websites that fit your exact needs. Indicia provides a set of services, tools 
and examples that can be added to almost any website to provide rich online 
recording functionality. Or, if you are starting from scratch then Instant 
Indicia gives you a ready to configure website installation that can be set up
as you require without any coding. 

Being a toolkit for you to build your own websites, you might worry that it will
take too much effort. Don't worry, the Instant Indicia tutorials available on 
the `download page <http://code.google.com/p/indicia/downloads/list>`_ take you 
through the process of **building your very own recording website in about 3 
hours**. Because Indicia allows complete flexibility in the data entry forms 
that can be created, it is suitable for anything from public participation 
surveys targeted at school children right through to structured long-term 
monitoring projects performed by professional surveyors.

Conceived as part of the 
`Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) <http://www.OPALexplorenature.org/>`_ and
managed by the `Centre for Ecology and Hydrology <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/>`_, 
Indicia is free and open source software serving the biological recording 
community within the UK and Europe.
