iRecord
-------

`iRecord <http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord>`_ is a general recording site for the 
United Kingdom, managed and hosted by `BRC <http://www.brc.ac.uk>`_. As well as
allowing recording of miscellaneous records, iRecord provides a data entry 
platform for organisations to host surveys on that don't have their own hosting
capacity. For example, iRecord is being used to host the Garden Bioblitz event
which was trialled in 2012 and will be launched to the public in 2013.

Furthermore, iRecord provides an expert verification portal not only for 
records collected on iRecord itself but any other websites sharing the BRC
Indicia warehouse hosting facilities that opt in via Indicia's data sharing
agreement facilities.

iRecord used Instant Indicia as a starting point for the website build with a 
selection of configured prebuilt forms for both data entry, reporting and 
data management. It makes use of the Easy Login and Forms and Surveys Library
features to synchronise logins across websites and to manage a collection of 
data input forms respectively.

NatureSpot is built using Drupal with the Indicia Forms module. Because Drupal
is a fully fledged content management system you can build any site features
you want around the online recording. In this case, NatureSpot features a 
comprehensive library of species accounts for species found in Leicestershire
and Rutland. There are also pages describing the wild places of the area which 
include content and site photos created using Drupal alongside recent records
and record photos from Indicia, using the site's boundary polygon to 
automatically calculate which records to include on the wild place's page.

Rather than capture ad-hoc records, the value of Spipoll data are increased by
following a set methodology which defines the information gathered, time spent
at each flower and method of collecting records. Spipoll also includes 
integration with a Bayesian key to help identify the pollinating insects.
