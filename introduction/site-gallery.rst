iRecord
-------

`iRecord <http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord>'_ is a general recording site for the 
United Kingdom, managed and hosted by `BRC <http://www.brc.ac.uk>`_. As well as
allowing recording of miscellaneous records, iRecord provides a data entry 
platform for organisations to host surveys on that don't have their own hosting
capacity. For example, iRecord is being used to host the Garden Bioblitz event
which was trialled in 2012 and will be launched to the public in 2013.

Furthermore, iRecord provides an expert verification portal not only for 
records collected on iRecord itself but any other websites sharing the BRC
Indicia warehouse hosting facilities that opt in via Indicia's data sharing
agreement facilities.

iRecord used Instant Indicia as a starting point for the website build with a 
selection of configured prebuilt forms for both data entry, reporting and 
data management. It makes use of the Easy Login and Forms and Surveys Library
features to synchronise logins across websites and to manage a collection of 
data input forms respectively.
