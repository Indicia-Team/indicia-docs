Example sites built using Indicia
*********************************

The best way to get a feel for what Indicia can do is to take a look at some 
example websites built using Indicia. This list of sites is not comprehensive
but does give a feel for the range of surveys that can be supported. Firstly, 
we'll look through some examples which are aimed at engaging the public in 
biological recording. These tend to have easy to use forms for capturing a 
species selected from a limited list of target species, a date and place. 
Normally the species involved will be easily identifiable and the site may 
provide additional identification assistance to make recording as simple as 
possible.

BBC Breathing Places Ladybird Survey
====================================

One example of this type of site is the 
`BBC Breathing Places Ladybird Survey <http://www.bbc.co.uk/breathingplaces/ladybird-survey>`_:

Despite the fact that this survey was aimed squarely at schools and members of 
the public who may have little identification skills, the online assistance 
provided ensures that many useful records are gathered. There is even a sibling 
ladybird parasite survey also on the BBC Breathing Places site!

Maach Mat!
==========

Another example of a public participation survey is the 
`Maach Mat (Take Part) survey <http://data.mnhn.lu/en/maach_mat>`_ run by the
*Musée national d'histoire naturelle* in Luxembourg. This survey has a very 
limited list of easily identified species to record in several categories. It's
also a good illustration of the multilingual capabilities of Indicia with the
user interface available in German, French, English and Luxembourgish!

Open Farm Sunday
================

During Open Farm Sunday 2012, farm visitors were offered the chance to 
participate in a survey of potential pollinators or to have a go at a simple 
"Discover Pollinators" checklist. The former was designed in collaboration with 
scientists at the `Centre for Ecology & Hydrology <http://www.ceh.ac.uk>`_ to 
ensure that the resultant data could be used in subsequent analysis despite 
having been collected by members of the public with no prior expertise. The 
survey's results have been compared against results collected by trained 
volunteers during the event to provide useful data on the accuracy of citizen 
science records. The online recording forms, shown below, were designed using 
Indicia to closely match the paper forms used in the field to ensure that the 
input was as intuitive as possible.

The Discover Pollinators form was intended to provide an opportunity for the 
public to engage with biological recording who had not been involved before. 
Again, the web version of the form below was carefully matched to the paper 
version as used in the field to ensure familiarity for members of the public
inputting their records.

North East Cetacean Project
===========================

`The North East Cetacean Project <http://www.northeastcetaceans.org.uk>`_ was one 
of the first surveys launched using Indicia and collects ad-hoc cetacean 
sigthings in the Northumberland region of England. The data input form includes
identification information for each species to help with recording accuracy.

NatureSpot
==========

It's also possible to use Indicia to build recording sites which are aimed at 
regular recorders, either for those recording within a taxonomic group or 
for generalist recorders working across groups. An example of the latter is the 
`NatureSpot <http://www.naturespot.org.uk>`_ site which allows naturalists in 
Leicestershire and Rutland to record all their sightings and photographs. This 
site supports entry of lists of any species at a particular date and time along
with photo upload, along with online data management and verification facilities.

At this point in time, over 18,000 photos have been uploaded to NatureSpot of
over 3,300 species.

NatureSpot is built using Drupal with the Indicia Forms module. Because Drupal
is a fully fledged content management system you can build any site features
you want around the online recording. In this case, NatureSpot features a 
comprehensive library of species accounts for species found in Leicestershire
and Rutland. There are also pages describing the wild places of the area which 
include content and site photos created using Drupal alongside recent records
and record photos from Indicia. These pages are of interest for a couple of 
reasons:

* The records and photos shown on each wild places page are calculated by 
  Indicia using the site's boundary polygon to automatically work out which 
  records to include. This sort of *spatial query* is easy because of the 
  **PostGIS** spatial database used by Indicia. 
* Drupal's content management facilities allow local site editors to edit the 
  text content on each wild place or species page using easy-to-use text 
  editors. There is therefore no need to pay a developer for general site 
  maintenance of this nature.

iRecord
=======

`iRecord <http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord>`_ is a general recording site for the 
United Kingdom, managed and hosted by the `Biological Records Centre <http://www.brc.ac.uk>`_. 

As well as online recording, iRecord provides an expert verification portal not 
only for records collected on iRecord itself but any other websites sharing the 
BRC Indicia warehouse hosting facilities that opt in via Indicia's :doc:`data 
sharing agreement <../administrating/warehouse/website-agreements>` facilities.

iRecord used Instant Indicia as a starting point for the website build with a 
selection of configured prebuilt forms for both data entry, reporting and 
data management. It makes use of the Easy Login and Forms and Surveys Library
features to synchronise logins across websites and to manage a collection of 
data input forms respectively. As well as allowing recording of miscellaneous 
records, iRecord provides a data entry platform for organisations to host 
surveys on that don't have their own hosting capacity. For example, iRecord is 
being used to host the Garden Bioblitz event which was trialled in 2012 and will
be launched to the public in 2013.

SPIPOLL
=======

As well as these generic recording solutions, it is also possible to use 
Indicia to develop highly specialised forms matched to particular survey 
methodologies. Engaging citizen scientists across France, `SPIPOLL <http://www.spipoll.org>`_ 
involves recording and photographing pollinators visiting flowers and includes 
tight integration into an existing Drupal site, an advanced search gallery and a 
highly customised data entry system.

Rather than capture ad-hoc records, the value of Spipoll data are increased by
following a set methodology which defines the information gathered, time spent
at each flower and method of collecting records. Spipoll also includes 
integration with a Bayesian key to help identify the pollinating insects.

Biomonitoring Luxembourg
========================

In Luxembourg, Indicia is not only used for public participation exercises like
Maach Mat, but also for long term monitoring of bird, bat, butterfly, reptile
and mammal species. The participant recorders follow strict methodologies for 
each of the surveys and the recording forms are correspondingly built for 
purpose. The following screenshot shows the customised input screen for 
butterfly transect recording:

Developing specialist solutions such as this does require some code to be 
written, but they are much easier to develop using the Indicia toolkit as a 
starting point than if you started from scratch.
