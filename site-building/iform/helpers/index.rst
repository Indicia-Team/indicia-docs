Helper Classes
==============

The majority of functionality provided by the Indicia client helpers is provided by a
number of functions in helper classes. These are static classes that do not need to be
instantiated and functions provide various controls for data entry, reporting and mapping
as well as some useful functions. When writing custom code using the client helpers API
you are likely to spend most of your time calling methods in these helper classes.
