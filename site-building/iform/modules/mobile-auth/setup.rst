Setting Up
==========

This section deals with the setting up process of the module. Since all the functionality
is set up on iRecord website, the following information applies only
to those who want to install their own system of recording.

.. note:: This documentation covers only Drupal 7.

Prerequisites
-------------

The main and only requirement for setting up Mobile Auth module is the
**iForm module** to be installed and configured on your Drupal site.


Installation
------------

You can download the module from Indicia's :ref:`Downloads page<http://www.indicia.org.uk/downloads>`
or checking it out from our repository using Subversion:

``svn co https://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/drupal_7/modules/iform_mobile_auth/trunk/iform_mobile_auth``

Depending on your Drupal installation the module should be placed in your
modules folder -``sites\all\modules``.
