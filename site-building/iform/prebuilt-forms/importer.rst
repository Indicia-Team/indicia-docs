Importer
-------------

The Importer provides a wizard for importing CSV files into the Indicia 
database. This will typically be occurrence data, but can also be configured to
support locations, species or any other type of information.

More information on the import process in general can be found in the
:doc:`../../../administrating/importing` documentation.
