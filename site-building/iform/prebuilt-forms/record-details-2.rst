Record Details 2
----------------

Provides a customisable view of a single record, ideal for linking to "Explore" reports.

If you install the `Metatag and Metatag: Open Graph <https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag>`_
modules, Record Details pages will add location, image and title metadata to the page which can be
picked up in links to Facebook and other social media.
