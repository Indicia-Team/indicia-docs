Walkthrough - Building your own iRecord
---------------------------------------

.. sidebar:: Prerequisites

  These tutorials are more advanced than the Introduction to Instant Indicia, so before
  starting it is worth making sure you at least know the basics of Drupal and Instant 
  Indicia. You should have:
  
  * completed the Instant Indicia tutorials, or have a good understanding
    of using the Indicia warehouse and Drupal IForm module.
  * a warehouse which you have registered a website on that you can experiment with.
  * a species list loaded onto the website for you to use, preferably with multiple taxon
    groups.
  * a fresh copy of Instant Indicia, updated with the latest code.
  
In this suite of tutorials, we'll take a look at how to build a site similar to `iRecord
<http://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord>`_, starting with a blank Instant Indicia site. In doing so
we'll be learning some of the advanced configuration techniques available in the Indicia
ecosystem including templating, notification emails and PHP coding using the Indicia
Client Helpers API. During the tutorials you will cover:

* The best way to associate users with their records.
* Advanced configuration of data entry forms
* Creating custom attributes from scratch
* Overriding the page stylesheets
* Cloning pages to make similar forms
* Adding a drop down menu system to the site
* Building a library of forms with the facility for recorders to keep a list of preferred
  forms
* Using the new Dynamic Reports page
* Adding a custom home page
