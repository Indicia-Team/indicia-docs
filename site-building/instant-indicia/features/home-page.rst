Home Page
---------

Creates a very simple page layout for the home page including an area for news and a
separate area for latest photos. Even if not used, this home page layout might provide a
useful example of how to use the Drupal **Panels** and **Page Manager** modules to create
custom page layouts which integrate both Drupal and Indicia content.
