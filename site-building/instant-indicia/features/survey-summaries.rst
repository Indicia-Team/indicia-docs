Survey Summaries
----------------

Enables a new Drupal content type for survey summary pages. Each survey summary page 
displays configurable summary data for a single survey, including:

* Records map
* Recorder league table
* Total records
* Latest photos

It is ideal for developing output pages for bioblitzes and similar public participation
surveys. The following example shows the summary page for the Garden Bioblitz 2012 trial
event.
