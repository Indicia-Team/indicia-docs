Verification
------------

Enables an Indicia page which supports expert verification of records. It adds a menu 
item in the Primary Links menu which links to a page created for verification of records.
It is recommended that this feature is combined with the :doc:`easy-login` feature for
control of verifier preferences and that the Data Cleaner and associated rule modules
are enabled on the warehouse to automate flagging of records which need thorough checking.
