..note::

  Instant Indicia was based on Drupal 6. We strongly recommend that if you are starting to 
  build a new online recording website that you use Drupal 7 and the IForm module since
  Drupal 6 is no longer the preferred version of Drupal. 
  
Introduction
============

Indicia is the only online recording toolkit developed from the ground-up for being
completely configurable and customisable to build the exact wildlife recording solution
you want. This includes both editable configuration options as well as full customisation
using the PHP development language. Of course, this level of flexibility means that 
learning all there is to know about Indicia can be quite bewildering. Fortunately Instant
Indicia provides a dramatically simplified process for building online recording sites
by providing a set of *building blocks* that you can easily turn on and off to build the
site you require. Unlike many other "simplified" solutions, the good news is that using 
Instant Indicia to get your site started does not prelude you from using all the detailed
configuration and customisation options which Indicia provides if required in future.

The fundamental concept behind Instant Indicia is a modified version of the Drupal
Content Management System (a generic tool for building content based websites) with
pre-configured options suitable for wildlife recording, including the installation of
the Indicia integration and other modules. In other words, when you install a Drupal
website normally, the installation process leaves you with a "blank sheet" and there is
a fair amount to setup to build the average site. When you install an Instant Indicia
site on the other hand, much of the required configuration is done for you.
Furthermore, Instant Indicia provides you with a list of **features** which you can
simply turn on and off to enable the ones you want. The features available include not
only online recording forms but also things like mapping, reporting and even discussion
forum functionality.
