Instant Indicia
===============

Introduction
------------

So, why are we interested in Instant Indicia?

One might like to think of Indicia as a cooking system where instead of making 
food you are making websites focused on biodiversity and in particular online 
recording. Indicia includes a collection of "ingredients" that can be used in 
various supplied “recipes” or even used to make entirely new ones. Following 
this analogy through, Instant Indicia is a collection of “ready meals” built 
using the Indicia cooking system that you simply put together to create the meal
of your choice. If you don’t like a particular aspect of a ready meal you are 
stuck with it, or have to cook from scratch. However, in Instant Indicia you can
tweak the ready meal just as readily as if you were cooking the meal from the 
beginning.

More specifically, Instant Indicia is an extension of the Drupal content 
management system for building online recording websites. Don’t worry if you 
don’t know what Drupal or a content management system are yet, as the tutorial 
will explain these concepts in due course. Once installed, the basis of an 
online recording site can be built simply by selecting from a number of 
ready-made building blocks and performing a few configuration tasks.
