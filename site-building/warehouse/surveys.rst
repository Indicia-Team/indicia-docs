Registering your survey
=======================

Firstly, note that in Indicia’s terminology a survey is a collection of records made for a
specific purpose across any number of site visits. As well as being used to categorise 
records, an important use of surveys in Indicia is to allow you to customise the 
information you will capture for a record at a survey level. For example, you might run a 
survey of hedgehogs in your area as well as a survey of garden birds. The garden bird 
survey could allow the user to tick a box for nesting birds as opposed to non-breeding 
visitors to the garden. Obviously it would not make sense to provide this checkbox on a 
form for inputting hedgehog records! Don’t worry about dividing your data up into several 
surveys if you need to in order to get the right attributes for each survey, as it is 
simple to join the data back together again when producing reports and maps later. Whilst 
we are on the topic of terminology, we will be using the following:

* *record* or *occurrence* describes a unique observation of a species on a specified
  date, at a specified place, by a specified person(s).

* *sample* describes the observation event that leads to the taking of zero or more
  occurrences, e.g. the use of a trap on a particular date by a particular person(s) at a
  particular place.

* *location* describes any named place which you are keeping details of in the system. A
  location may be a site that you visit for recording purposes, but could also be
  something like a town or other place name.

Follow these steps to register a new survey for recording on the warehouse.

#. Login using the warehouse login you created in the previous step, who has admin rights 
   to the website registration you have created for your website. If you have not already 
   setup the website and user, please see the Setting up a website registration tutorial.
#. Select Lookup lists > Surveys from the warehouse’s menu. You should now be on a page 
   that shows a grid of surveys that already exist. Like the websites list, there is a 
   demonstration item added to the list during installation to provide somewhere to add 
   records which are for demo and testing purposes.
#. Click the New survey button. This takes you to the New Survey page.
#. Enter a title for your survey as well as an optional description. For the purposes of 
   this tutorial we will set up a survey called “Damselflies”.
#. Select the website you are using this survey for from the Website drop-down at the 
   bottom.
