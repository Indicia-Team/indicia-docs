Setting up a website registration
=================================

In Indicia, in order for an online recording survey form to exist you first need to create 
an entity to have ownership of that survey and associated information. This allows the 
warehouse to manage who has permission to change this information, for example, you would
not want the administrator of a dragonfly recording website to change the attributes that
were created and are owned by a plant recording website. Because this division of 
ownership is normally done at the client website level (i.e. each online recording website
has ownership of the attributes, termlists and custom attributes created specifically for
it) we call the entity which the ownership is associated with a "website" for simplicity,
even if this is not always accurate.

Before you can store any data in an Indicia warehouse, you need to register your website
with the warehouse so that the warehouse can ensure that your data is only accessible to
your website. Other websites which are registered on the same warehouse will only be
able to access their own records.

.. note::

  If you do not have access to the admin login for the warehouse you are using, you will
  need to ask the administrator of the warehouse to create your website registration for
  you. Please provide them with your website title, URL, an optional description and a
  secure password as well as your email address. Once setup, they will provide you with a
  website ID which you need to keep for future use along with the password. They can also
  provide you with a username and password which you can use to login to the warehouse in
  future with access to just your own data. Once logged in, please change your password to
  a secure password.
  
If you are going to register the website on the warehouse yourself, then please follow 
these steps.

#. Using your web browser, navigate to the web address of the Indicia warehouse. The 
   address will either have been provided for you or will be the address you installed it 
   at if you installed it yourself. This will present you with a login page:

#. Login to the Indicia warehouse using the admin warehouse login. You will either have 
   created this login when you installed the warehouse, or it should have been provided 
   for you.
   
   .. note::
   
     You may see a warning at the top of the warehouse’s home page, informing you that 
     there are configuration issues on the server. These warnings are important on a live 
     server as they indicate parts of the installation that should be completed, but if 
     the server is for training or development only it is safe to ignore certain warnings 
     (e.g. about setting the server up for email and also locking down permissions on 
     certain directories to improve security).
     
#. Select Admin > Websites from the menu at the top. This will show you a grid listing 
   websites already available on the warehouse. Immediately after installation this  
   typically shows a single website called Demonstration Website.

#. Click the New website button.
#. Enter the title of your website, e.g. “Tutorial”.
#. Fill in the URL of the website you will be setting up, e.g. http://www.mytutorial.com. 
   Note that this is just a link to the website for reference purposes. You can optionally 
   provide a description for the website. Specify a password which will be used to 
   authenticate that data posted to the server actually came from your website, and enter 
   it again in the Retype Password box to confirm it. If you are registering a website for
   live data as opposed to one for testing or development purposes, please ensure that 
   this password is strong (e.g. it includes punctuation, capitals and numbers rather than
   being a word which can be easily looked up in a dictionary scan).

#. Click the Save button.
#. The website registration you have just created has been given a **website ID** which 
   uniquely identifies the website to the warehouse. This, along with the password you 
   entered, are important pieces of information that you will need when setting up your 
   online recording. At the back of this tutorial there is a space you can use to keep a 
   note of the website ID and password. The new website registration’s website ID is 
   visible in the grid in the leftmost column.

   Now that you have registered the website, it is a good idea to avoid logging into the
   warehouse in future using the admin account, since this account can change any data for
   any website registered on the warehouse. The Indicia warehouse maintains a list of
   **people** known to it. People can include anyone associated with the data, e.g. 
   recorders, determiners or anyone else. There is also a list of users which are people 
   that can log in to the warehouse. Every user must exist in the list of people, but not 
   every person exists in the list of users. So, to be able to log in to the warehouse you 
   have to exist as a person first, then to be added to the list of users.
   
   If you don’t already have a separate warehouse login of your own, then follow these 
   steps to create a user on the warehouse:
   
   #. Select **Lookup Lists > People** from the menu.
   #. Click the **New Person** button.
   #. Enter the details of the person who will act as the administrator of the website you 
      are building, including at least their first name, surname and email address. Other 
      fields are optional.
   #. In Indicia, a person can be added to the list of known people without actually 
      making them into a user who can login to the warehouse. For example the person might 
      be a recorder who you accept records from but does not use Indicia. To convert the 
      person record you have created into a user of the warehouse, select **Admin > 
      Users** from the menu.
   #. Find the person record you just created then click **Edit User Details** in that 
      row.

        :alt: The Edit User Details link.
        
   #. In the User’s Details, note the Username that has been generated or change it if 
      required.
   #. Indicia will fill in a suggested password for all new users of “P4ssw0rd”, but 
      rather than use this default it is a good idea to specify your own. Enter a 
      password for the user in the **Password** control and confirm it in the **Repeat 
      Password** control.
   #. In the Website Roles list, select Admin in the drop down box next to the name of the
      Website you created (e.g. “Tutorial”):
      
      .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/warehouse/new_user.png

        :alt: Creating a new warehouse user.
 
   #. Save the page.
   
You will need to remember the username and password for the warehouse login you just
created and there is a space for noting these at the back of this tutorial.

If you need to add an existing user to the website you have registered, then you can
select Admin > Users from the menu and click the Edit user details link in that row, then
simply modify the Website Roles section as before and click Save.

Finally, select **Logged in as admin > Logout** from the menu to take you back to the login
page.
